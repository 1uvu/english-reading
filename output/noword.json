All but two pieces sold, fetching more than \uffe170m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last victory.

At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons Clare Mc Andrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm\u2014double the figure five years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos, greed, passion and controversy in a way matched by few other industries.\n@##\n    In the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst\u2019s sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable, especially in New York, where the bail-out of the banks coincided with the loss of thousands of jobs and the financial demise of many art-buying investors. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector\u2014for Chinese contemporary art\u2014they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world\u2019s two biggest auction houses, Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them.\n@##\n    The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the  end of 1989, a move that started the most serious contraction in the market since the Second World War.

Christie\u2019s revenues in the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006.

In some states, for example, jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence, education, and moral character.

In the landmark 1975 decision Taylor vs. Louisiana, the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all parts of the community to the state level.

Sit down to read and the flywheel of work-related thoughts keeps spinning-or else you\u2019re so exhausted that a challenging book\u2019s the last thing you need. The modern mind, Tim Parks, a novelist and critic, writes, \u201cis overwhelmingly inclined toward communication\u2026It is not simply that one is interrupted; it is that one is actually inclined to interruption\u201d. Deep reading requires not just time, but a special kind of time which can\u2019t be obtained merely by becoming more efficient.\n@##\nIn fact, \u201cbecoming more efficient\u201d is part of the problem. Thinking of time as a resource to be maximised means you approach it instrumentally, judging any given moment as well spent only in so far as it advances progress toward some goal immersive reading, by contrast, depends on being willing to risk inefficiency, goallessness, even time-wasting. Try to slot it as a to-do list item and you\u2019ll manage only goal-focused reading-useful, sometimes, but not the most fulfilling kind. \u201cThe future comes at us like empty bottles along an unstoppable and nearly infinite conveyor belt,\u201d writes Gary Eberle in his book Sacred Time, and \u201cwe feel a pressure to fill these different-sized bottles (days, hours, minutes)as they pass, for if they get by without being filled, we will have wasted them\u201d. No mind-set could be worse for losing yourself in a book.\n@##\nSo what does work? Perhaps surprisingly, scheduling regular times for reading. You\u2019d think this might fuel the efficiency mind-set, but in fact, Eberle notes, such ritualistic behaviour helps us \u201cstep outside time\u2019s flow\u201d into \u201csoul time\u201d. You could limit distractions by reading only physical books, or on single-purpose e-readers. \u201cCarry a book with you at all times\u201d can actually work, too-providing you dip in often enough, so that reading becomes the default state from which you temporarily surface to take care of business, before dropping back down.

This is why researchers\ngenerally regard so-called moral guilt, in the right amount, to be a good thing.\n@##\nIn the popular imagination, of course, guilt still gets a bad rap. It is deeply uncomfortable -- it\u2019s the emotional\nequivalent of wearing a jacket weighted with stones. Yet this understanding is outdated. \u201cThere has been a kind of\nrevival or a rethinking about what guilt is and what role guilt can serve,\u201d says Amrisha Vaish, a psychology researcher\nat the University of Virginia, adding that this revival is part of a larger recognition that emotions aren't binary --feelings\nthat may be advantageous in one context may be harmful in another. Jealousy and anger, for example, may have\nevolved to alert us to important inequalities. Too much happiness can be destructive.\n@##\nAnd guilt, by prompting us to think more deeply about our goodness, can encourage humans to make up for errors\nand fix relationships. Guilt, in other words, can help hold a cooperative species together. It is a kind of social glue.\n@##\nViewed in this light, guilt is an opportunity. Work by Tina Malti, a psychology professor at the University of\nToronto, suggests that guilt may compensate for an emotional deficiency. In a number of studies, Malti and others have\nshown that guilt and sympathy may represent different pathways to cooperation and sharing Some Kids who are low in\nsympathy may make up for that shortfall by experiencing more guilt, which can rein in their nastier impulses.

Even as we\nhumans count on forests to soak up a good share of the carbon dioxide we produce, we are threatening their ability to\ndo so. The climate change we are hastening could one day leave us with forests that emit more carbon than they absorb.\n@##\nThankfully, there is a way out of this trap-but it involves striking a subtle balance. Helping forests flourish as\nvaluable \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d long into the future may require reducing their capacity to sequester carbon now. California is\nleading the way, as it does on so many climate efforts, in figuring out the details.\n@##\nThe state\u2019s proposed Forest Carbon Plan aims to double efforts to thin out young trees and clear brush in parts of\nthe forest, including by controlled burning. This temporarily lowers carbon-carrying capacity. But the remaining trees\ndraw a greater share of the available moisture, so they grow and thrive, restoring the forest\u2019s capacity to pull carbon\nfrom the air. Healthy trees are also better able to fend off insects. The landscape is rendered less easily burnable. Even\nin the event of a fire, fewer trees are consumed.\n@##\nThe need for such planning is increasingly urgent. Already, since 2010, drought and insects have killed over 100\nmillion trees in California, most of them in 2016 alone, and wildfires have burned hundreds of thousands of acres.\n@##\nCalifornia\u2019s plans treat 35,000 acres of forest a year by 2020, and 60,000 by 2030 -financed from the proceeds of\nthe state\u2019s emissions-permit auctions. That\u2019s only a small share of the total acreage that could benefit, about half a\nmillion acres in all, so it will be vital to prioritize areas at greatest risk of fire or drought.\n@##\nThe strategy also aims to ensure that carbon in woody material removed from the forests is locked away in the\nform of solid lumber or burned as biofuel in vehicles that would otherwise run on fossil fuels. New research on\ntransportation biofuels is already under way.\n@##\nState governments are well accustomed to managing forests, but traditionally they\u2019ve focused on wildlife,\nwatersheds and opportunities for recreation.
