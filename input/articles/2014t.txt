What would you do with 590m? This is now a question for Gloria Mackenzie, an 84-year-old widow who recently emerged from her small, tin-roofed house in Florida to collect the biggest undivided lottery jackpot in history. If she hopes her new-found for tune will yield lasting feelings of fulfillment, she could do worse than read Happy Money by Elizabeth Dumn and Michael Norton.
@##
These two academics use an array of behavioral research to show that the most rewarding ways to spend money can be counterintuitive. Fantasies of great wealth often involve visions of fancy cars and extravagant homes. Yet satisfaction with these material purchases wears off fairly quickly what was once exciting and new becomes old-hat; regret creeps in. It is far better to spend money on experiences, say Ms Dumn and Mr Norton, like interesting trips, unique meals or even going to the cinema. These purchases often become more valuable with time-as stories or memories-particularly if they involve feeling more connected to others.
@##
This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the most "happiness bang for your buck." It seems most people would be better off if they could shorten their commutes to work, spend more time with friends and family and less of it watching television (something the average American spends a whopping two months a year doing, and is hardly jollier for it).Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more pleasurable than purchasing things for oneself, and luxuries are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly. This is apparently the reason MacDonald's restricts the availability of its popular McRib - a marketing trick that has turned the pork sandwich into an object of obsession.
@##
Readers of ¡°HappyMoney¡± are clearly a privileged lot, anxious about fulfillment, not hunger.Money may not quite buy happiness, but people in wealthier countries are generally happier than those in poor ones. Yet the link between feeling good and spending money on others can be seen among rich and poor people around the world, and scarcity enhances the pleasure of most things for most people. Not everyone will agree with the authors¡¯ policy ideas, which range from mandating more holiday time to reducing tax incentives for American homebuyers. But most people will come away from this book believing it was money well spent.

An article in Scientific America has pointed out that empirical research says that, actually, you think you¡¯re more beautiful than you are. We have a deep-seated need to feel good about ourselves and we naturally employ a number of self-enhancing strategies to research into what the call the ¡°above average effect¡±, or ¡°illusory superiority¡±, and shown that, for example, 70% of us rate ourselves as above average in leadership, 93% in driving and 85% at getting on well with others¡ªall obviously statistical impossibilities.
@##
We rose tint our memories and put ourselves into self-affirming situations. We become defensive when criticized, and apply negative stereotypes to others to boost our own esteem, we stalk around thinking we¡¯re hot stuff.
@##
Psychologist and behavioral scientist Nicholas Epley oversaw a key studying into self-enhancement and attractiveness. Rather that have people simply rate their beauty compress with others, he asked them to identify an original photogragh of themselves¡¯ from a lineup including versions that had been altered to appear more and less attractive. Visual recognition, reads the study, is ¡°an automatic psychological process occurring rapidly and intuitively with little or no apparent conscious deliberation¡±. If the subjects quickly chose a falsely flattering image- which must did- they genuinely believed it was really how they looked.
@##
Epley found no significant gender difference in responses. Nor was there any evidence that, those who self-enhance the must (that is, the participants who thought the most positively doctored picture were real) were doing so to make up for profound insecurities. In fact those who thought that the images higher up the attractiveness scale were real directly corresponded with those who showed other makers for having higher self-esteem. ¡°I don¡¯t think the findings that we having have are any evidence of personal delusion¡±, says Epley. ¡°It¡¯s a reflection simply of people generally thinking well of themselves¡¯. If you are depressed, you won¡¯t be self-enhancing. 
@##
Knowing the results of Epley ¡®s study,it makes sense that why people heat photographs of themselves Viscerally-on one level, they don¡¯t even recognise the person in the picture as themselves, Facebook therefore ,is a self-enhancer¡¯s paradise,where people can share only the most flattering photos, the cream of their wit ,style ,beauty, intellect and lifestyle it¡¯s not that people¡¯s profiles are dishonest,says catalina toma of Wiscon¡ªMadison university ,¡±but they portray an idealized version of themselves.

The concept of man versus machineis at least as old as the industrial revolution, but this phenomenon tends tobe most acutely felt during economic downturns and fragile recoveries. And yet,it would be a mistake to think we are right now simply experiencing the painfulside of a boom and bust cycle. Certain jobs have gone away for eating up humanjobs, this phenomenon will continue to restructure our economy in ways we can¡¯timmediately foresee.
@##
When there is exponential improvement in theprice and performance of technology, jobs that were once thought to be immunefrom automation suddenly become threatened. This argument has attracted a lotof attention, via the success of the book Race Against the Machine, byErik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, whoboth hail from MITs Center for Digital Business.
@##
This is a powerful argument, and a scaryone. And yet, John Hagel, auther of The power of pull and other books, saysBrynjolfsson and McAfee miss the reason why these jobs are so vulnerable totechnology in the first place.
@##
Hagel says we have designed jobs in the U.S.that tend to be ¡°tightly scripted¡± and ¡°highly standardized¡± ones that leave noroom for ¡°individual initiative or creativity.¡± In short, these are the typesof jobs that machines can perform much better at than human beings. That is howwe have put a giant target sign on the backs of American workers, Hagel says.
@##
It¡¯s time to reinvent the formula for howwork is conducted, since we are still relying on a very 20th centurynotion of work, Hagel says. In our rapidly changing economy, we more than everneed people in the workplace who can take initiative and exercise theirimagination ¡°to respond to unexpected events.¡± That¡¯s not something machinesare good at. They are designed to perform very predictable activities.
@##
As Hagel notes, Brynjolfsson and McAfeeindeed touched on this point in their book. We need to reframe race against themachine as race with the machine. In our works, we need to look at the ways inwhich machines can augment human labor rather than replace it. So then theproblem is not really about technology, but rather, ¡°how do we innovate ourinstitutions and our work practices?¡±

When the government talks about infrastructure contributing to the economy the focus is usually on roads, railways, broadband and energy. Housing is seldom mentioned.
@##
Why is that? To some extent the housing sector must shoulder the blame. We have not been good at communicating the real value that housing can contribute to economic growth. Then there is the scale of the typical housing project. It is hard to shove for attention among multibillion-pound infrastructure project, so it is inevitable that the attention is focused elsewhere. But perhaps the most significant reason is that the issue has always been so politically charged.
@##
Nevertheless, the affordable housing situation is desperate. Waiting lists increase all the time and we are simply not building enough new homes.
@##
The comprehensive spending review offers an opportunity for the government to help rectify this. It needs to put historical prejudices to one side and take some steps to address our urgent housing need.
@##
There are some indications that it is preparing to do just that. The communities minister, Don Foster, has hinted that George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, may introduce more flexibility to the current cap on the amount that local authorities can borrow against their housing stock debt. Evidence shows that 60,000 extra new homes could be built over the next five years if the cap were lifted, increasing GDP by 0.6%.
@##
Ministers should also look at creating greater certainty in the rental environment, which would have a significant impact on the ability of registered providers to fund new developments from revenues.
@##
But it is not just down to the government. While these measures would be welcome in the short term, we must face up to the fact that the existing ?4.5bn programme of grants to fund new affordable housing, set to expire in 2015,is unlikely to be extended beyond then. The Labour party has recently announced that it will retain a large part of the coalition¡¯s spending plans if returns to power. The housing sector needs to accept that we are very unlikely to ever return to era of large-scale public grants. We need to adjust to this changing climate.
@##
While the government's commitment to long-term funding may have 
changed, the very pressing need for more affordable housing is real and is not going away.
